# Integrated Design Project

## ELEC3848

This repository contains code for my Integrated Design Project, for which I had to build a Smart Home system. 

The Smart Home system consists of 5 main components:

- Motion Dection Security Camera
- Automatic Temperature Control
- Intelligent Lighting System
- Smart Door Lock
- Solar Panel + Automatic Light Tracker

In addition to all of the above, A Raspberry Pi control center was added to run a Smart Miror ([MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)) to monitor the 
home at our own convenience.
